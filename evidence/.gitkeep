# Evidence Directory

This directory contains evidence packs generated by demo scripts and platform operations.

Each evidence pack is a timestamped directory containing:
- JSON artifacts with structured evidence
- SQL models and test suites
- Policy check results and audit events
- Human-readable markdown summaries

Evidence packs are auditor-ready and demonstrate EGD + AUREUS compliance.
